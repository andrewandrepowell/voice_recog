Complete repo for a voice recognition project

EDA tool: Vivado 2019.2

1. Data Aquisition: First step is going to be getting the data from the hardware on to the PC. Will be using a combination of the Microblaze, Ethernet, FreeRTOS, lwIP, and Python to accomplish this task.
2. Experimentation: Once I have a reliable means of acquiring the data, then I will start to look into pattern recognition algorithms suitable for FPGAs.
